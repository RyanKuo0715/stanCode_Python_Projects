## stanCode Projects
I worked as a Python programming teaching assistant at stanCode between Febuary 2024 and August 2024. This repository holds my examples of homeworks for students in the SC101 courses, which cover topics of object-oriented programming, data structure, web crawling, recursion, and algorithms such as DFS and BFS.
